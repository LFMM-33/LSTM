# LSTM
Experiment with an LSTM network for our project. The script is based in the following tutorial: https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/keras-lstm-tutorial/

The main files are:

  LSTM_ANN -> script containing the definition of the LSTM network and its training. Ends with some plots to see the results of the training.
  
  cm_pretty -> script found online to plot a nice confusion matrix using matplotlib.
  
  SubANN -> group of "side-functions" used in the LSTM_ANN to prepare the data and keep the LSTM script clean.
